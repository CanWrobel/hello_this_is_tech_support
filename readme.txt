Hi,
whenever I have to look up something, chances are high that I have to look it up again. In a year. In 3 months maybe? 
Opera under ubuntu forced me to do this because the snap has features that the manual install doesnt out of the box
and the manual install has other features that dont work out of the box 

def reasons I beat myself up to use opera:
  but man GUI clipboad integration, insert last used files instead of searching in the file tree?
  yes
  whatsapp in sidebar?
  yes yes
  chrome extensions compatible?
  yes yes yes
  built in super fast VPN?
  YESSS
  pass
