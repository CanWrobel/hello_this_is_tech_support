This git project exists just because the manual install of opera in ubuntu doesnt come with the ability to play videos properly (because of cutting costs)
I am dependent of other nice features that opera delivers they make my life so much easier so its worth the hassle

opera snap doesnt deliver features of the manual install and the manual install doesnt deliver on ffmpeg coded.
  dont use the snap version use the manual version and add the ffmpeg manually:
